# General instructions

When configuring and building IREE, use the `default` CMake preset unless told otherwise.

The build will be in `../build`, and the built tools will be in `../build/tools` (which is on $PATH).

When adding tests, conform to the style of existing tests in the file being edited or of similar files.
